    "Plan of Action:\n",
    "    1. Use starter pack to generate questions to see how good it is at doing it.\n",
    "    2. If it is bad at it, we will come back and write our own question generator in the future, but we will use it for now.\n",
    "    3. Start the report generation task\n",
    "    4. Sample ideas include: Using NLP models to \"average out\" the repetitive questions for less API usage. Have predetermined categories for types of questions. Each category must be answered in the report. Some examples of category include but are not limited to, author bias, fact cross checking, author reputation, general question asking related to the topic at hand."
